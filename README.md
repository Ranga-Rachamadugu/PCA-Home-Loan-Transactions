# PCA-Home-Loan-Transactions
Lending is one of the critical functions of any bank or financial institution. Customers are provided loans across different products (home loan, loan against property etc.) at competitive interest rates for an acceptable tenure. There is always a risk that a customer may default on the loan or may try and repay the loan in advance which leads to financial losses to the business.    There may not be enough data or evidence available from the past which will help the firm to predict the loan default or prepayment and mitigate the above possible risk. However, it does have information about the customer demographics, loan details, EMI transactions etc. which contributes to more than 25-30 features (high-dimension data) related to a customerâ€™s loan account. But due to high dimensions it is difficult to identify any patterns within the data. Unsupervised learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis comes to rescue here to reduce the high dimensionality and help in further analysis and pattern recognition.
